## Project Overview

Full-stack PetClinic application with Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend, managing veterinary clinic operations (owners, pets, vets, visits, specialties)

**Structure:**
- `petclinic-backend/` - Spring Boot 3.5 REST API (Java 21), Maven-built
- `petclinic-frontend/` - Angular 16 SPA (Angular Material + Bootstrap 3), npm built
- `petclinic-chatbot/` - Spring AI triage assistant (RAG over specialties, talks to the backend MCP)
- `petclinic-database/` - `PostgresLauncher` for the embedded Postgres, plus a network-latency proxy
- `petclinic-observability/` - `grafana/otel-lgtm` compose file + OTel collector config
- `petclinic-test/` - Playwright/Cucumber e2e suite (TypeScript, npm), also renders sequence diagrams from traces
- `refactoring-legacy/` - self-contained OpenRewrite module; never wired into the backend build
- `user-manual/` - `manual.md` and its screenshots
- `scripts/` - shared shell/python helpers (`ensure-human-review.sh`, `list-unversioned-deps.py`)

## Common Commands

### Helper Scripts
Each script is foreground; run them in separate terminals.
```sh
./start-database.sh        # embedded Postgres on localhost:5432
./start-backend.sh         # Spring Boot on localhost:8080 (also hosts Spring AI MCP at /mcp)
./start-frontend.sh        # Angular dev server on localhost:4200
./start-grafana.sh         # Starts grafana on localhost:3300 in a docker container
petclinic-backend/docs/scripts/start-structurizr.sh  # optional: C4model Structurizr view on localhost:8081
petclinic-backend/docs/generate-codecity.sh  # rebuilds docs/generated/codecity/codecity.html, the 3D code view.
     # Renderer = github.com/victorrentea/code-city, cloned into petclinic-backend/.tools/codecity/
     # (gitignored); change the rendering there, here only its output is committed.
```

## Architecture


### The /human-review skill lives in its own repo

`.claude/skills/human-review` is a **symlink** to `~/workspace/human-review/skills/human-review`
(github.com/victorrentea/human-review, public, installable as a Claude Code plugin). Edit it
there, not here — an edit through the symlink is an edit to that repo, and needs committing
there too.

The PlantUML differs moved with it. `docs/scripts/puml-diff/puml-diff-vs-git.sh` reaches
them through `scripts/ensure-human-review.sh`, which uses the symlink locally and clones the
repo into a gitignored `petclinic-backend/.tools/` otherwise. Never vendor a second copy: a
private fork of the review pipeline drifts in silence.

**The review guide is built by hand, not by CI.** It deep-links into a working tree and
drives a whole local stack — a browser, a database, Tempo, PlantUML, a Maven build — so
there is no online version and no PR automation for it. Run `/human-review` when you want
one. `diagram-preview.yml` still posts a PR comment rendering the branch's own diagrams,
which is a different and much cheaper thing: proxy URLs, no runner render, no publishing.

### Living Architecture & Guardrails

See [GUARDRAILS.md](GUARDRAILS.md) for the full list of guardrail tests, living architecture diagrams, and CI drift checks.

### Database
- **Dev:** Embedded PostgreSQL via `./start-database.sh` (Java jar, localhost:5432)
- **Tests:** Embedded PostgreSQL (auto-started in-process, no setup needed)
- **Flyway seeds the DB when the backend boots** (`ddl-auto=none`; `db/migration/`: schema in
  `V1`, sample data in `V3__sample_data.sql`). An empty DB before that is normal, not broken.
- ⚠️ `./start-database.sh` starts by `rm -rf data`, wiping any rows added at runtime. Use it only
  for a deliberate reset; to keep runtime data, start Postgres from the jar directly.

### Security
- Disabled by default
- Enable via `petclinic.security.enable=true`
- Roles: `OWNER_ADMIN`, `VET_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`
- Default test user: `admin`/`admin`

### Observability
- `./start-grafana.sh` brings up `grafana/otel-lgtm` (Grafana **:3300**, admin/admin; OTLP **:4317/:4318**).
- `./start-backend.sh` attaches the OTel Java agent **only if :4318 is already listening** — start
  Grafana *first*, otherwise the backend runs with telemetry silently disabled.
- Browser spans need a flush window: a scenario that finishes in <~5s closes the page before the
  frontend exporter ships anything, so no frontend traces reach Tempo.
- The agent is pinned at **2.20.1** and told to capture the maximum: SQL unsanitized, **bound
  query parameters** (`db.query.parameter.<n>`, which need `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=database/dup`
  and only exist from agent ~2.20 — 2.10 has no such flag). What a sequence diagram *shows* is
  decided at render time in `petclinic-test/` (`SEQ_SQL`, `SEQ_HTTP_BODIES`), never here.
- The agent jar is versioned in its filename — otherwise an already-downloaded
  `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar` makes a version bump a silent no-op.
- `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true` makes Hibernate prefix each
  statement with the HQL that produced it, so a trace can say which call a bare
  `select … from owners` came from — the agent captures no HQL of its own. It only fires
  for queries *written* as HQL (`@Query`); a Spring Data derived method is assembled
  through the Criteria API and comments itself `/* <criteria> */`, and an entity or lazy
  load carries no comment at all. The sequence diagrams fall back accordingly — see
  `petclinic-test/CLAUDE.md`. **A backend started before this property was added labels
  every DB arrow `SELECT petclinic`; restart it and re-record.**


## API Endpoints
Backend exposes REST API at http://localhost:8080/api/
REST Contract: 
- Owners: `/api/owners`, `/api/owners/{id}`
- Pets: `/api/pets`, `/api/pets/{id}`
- Vets: `/api/vets`, `/api/vets/{id}`
- Visits: `/api/visits`
- PetTypes: `/api/pettypes`
- Specialties: `/api/specialties`
- Users: `/api/users`
OpenAPI docs: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Domain Model
Core entities and relationships:
- **Owner** 1→N **Pet** N→1 **PetType**
- **Pet** 1→N **Visit**
- **Vet** N→N **Specialty** (via `vet_specialties` join table)
- **User** 1→N **Role**

## Task Modifiers
- Write non-trivial code using TDD
- Keep comments concise, prefer explanatory variable/method names
- Don't leave behind comments when deleting or moving stuff, to prevent later 'heresy resurrection'
- Always run tests after any refactoring
- Keep your explanations concise
- Challenge ambiguous prompts - I love hearing I'm wrong!  
- Before any git commit, make sure your changes are reflected in CLAUDE.md
