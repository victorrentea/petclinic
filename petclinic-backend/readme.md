# PetClinic Backend - Spring Boot REST API

> **Note**: This is the backend subproject. See [main README](../README.md) for full-stack setup.

Spring Boot REST API providing veterinary clinic management endpoints.

## Running Backend

### Local Development
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Access:
- API: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- Health check: [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health)
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## 📖 API Documentation

**Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)  
**OpenAPI spec (OAS 3.1)**: [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

For complete API endpoints overview, see [main README](../README.md#-api-endpoints-overview).

## Database configuration

By default, Petclinic uses an **in-memory H2 database**, which is automatically populated with sample data at startup.

### Supported databases

Petclinic uses Spring Data JPA as its single persistence implementation. Supported runtime databases are:

- H2 (default, in-memory)
- PostgreSQL (persistent)

Switch profiles by setting `spring.profiles.active` in `application.properties`, for example:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=h2
```
or for postgres:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=postgres
```
The application relies on Spring Boot auto-configuration for JPA; no additional repository wiring is required.


### **Using H2 (Default)**
- No additional setup is required.
- The database schema and sample data are loaded automatically from `src/main/resources/db/h2/`.
- You can access the **H2 Console** to inspect the database.

### **Accessing the H2 Console**
1. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
2. **Open H2 Console in your browser:**
   - **URL**: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
   - **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:petclinic`
   - **Username**: `sa`
   - **Password**: _(leave blank)_

### **Using PostgreSQL**
Modify application.properties:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=postgres
```
Start a PostgreSQL database using Docker:
```bash
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 postgres:16.3
```

Instead of manually running containers, you can also use `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
# start postgres service
docker-compose --profile postgres up
```

## API First Approach

This API is built following some [API First approach principles](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/).

It is specified through the [OpenAPI](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/).
It is specified in this [file](./src/main/resources/openapi.yml).

Some of the required classes are generated during the build time. 
Here are the generated file types:
* DTOs
* API template interfaces specifying methods to override in the controllers

To see how to get them generated you can read the next chapter. 

## Generated code

Some of the required classes are generated during the build time using maven or any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ Idea or Eclipse).

All of these classes are generated into the ``target/generated-sources`` folder.

Here is a list of the generated packages and the corresponding tooling:

| Package name                                   | Tool             |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| org.springframework.samples.petclinic.mapper   | [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/)        |
| org.springframework.samples.petclinic.rest.dto | [OpenAPI Generator maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) |


To get both, you have to run the following command:

```jshelllanguage
mvn clean install
```

## Security configuration
In its default configuration, Petclinic doesn't have authentication and authorization enabled.

### Basic Authentication
In order to use the basic authentication functionality, turn in on from the `application.properties` file
```properties
petclinic.security.enable=true
```
This will secure all APIs and in order to access them, basic authentication is required.
Apart from authentication, APIs also require authorization. This is done via roles that a user can have.
The existing roles are listed below with the corresponding permissions 

* `OWNER_ADMIN` -> `OwnerController`, `PetController`, `PetTypeController` (`getAllPetTypes` and `getPetType`), `VisitController`
* `VET_ADMIN`   -> `PetTypeController`, `SpecialityController`, `VetController`
* `ADMIN`       -> `UserController`

There is an existing user with the username `admin` and password `admin` that has access to all APIs.
 In order to add a new user, please make `POST /api/users` request with the following payload:

```json
{
    "username": "secondAdmin",
    "password": "password",
    "enabled": true,
    "roles": [
    	{ "name" : "OWNER_ADMIN" }
    ]
}
```

## Working with Petclinic in Eclipse/STS

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/
* Eclipse with the [mapstruct plugin](https://mapstruct.org/documentation/ide-support/) installed.

### Steps:

1) In the command line
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/petclinic-rest.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```

## Publishing a Docker image

This application uses [Google Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) to build an optimized Docker image into the [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/springcommunity/repository/docker/springcommunity/petclinic-rest/) repository.
The [pom.xml](pom.xml) has been configured to publish the image with name: `springcommunity/petclinic-rest`

Command line to run:
```sh
mvn compile jib:build -X -DjibSerialize=true -Djib.to.auth.username=xxx -Djib.to.auth.password=xxxxx
```

## Performance Testing

To benchmark the scalability of the PetClinic REST API, a JMeter test plan is available.

- See the [JMeter Performance Test](src/test/jmeter/README.md) for details.
- Run the test using:
  ```sh
  jmeter -n -t src/test/jmeter/petclinic-jmeter-crud-benchmark.jmx \
  -Jthreads=100 -Jduration=600 -Jops=2000 -Jramp_time=120 \
  -l results/petclinic-test-results.jtl

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/petclinic-rest/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
